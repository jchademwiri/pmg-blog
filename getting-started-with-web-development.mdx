- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Styles HTML elements to make them visually appealing and responsive.

- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Choose a Text Editor:

Select a code editor that suits your preferences. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.

### Install a Web Browser:

Use browsers like Google Chrome or Firefox for testing and debugging your web projects.
